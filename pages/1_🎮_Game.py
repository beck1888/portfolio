This project was to show off my skills with conditional logic. It features a shopping game where the user can put items in their basket.
            However, there is a budget the user must stay within, and there are certain 'necessities' the user must spend money on, requiring them to plan ahead.
            To make this even more interactive, I added sound effects using a module called playsound. Later, I switched to using pygame for this
            because Replit does not support playsound.""")
